`I am working on a project about chocolate sales. I have information about sales person, country, product, date of sale, amount (in dolars) and number of boxes shipped. I need to create good questions that explore this data to work a dashboard. Could you give me some ideas of questions I should try to answer on this project?`

`Absolutely, Luiza — this is a valuable opportunity to develop strategic thinking in data storytelling and dashboard design. Since you're working with chocolate sales data, you can derive significant business insights by defining questions that cover sales performance, market trends, product dynamics, and operational efficiency. Here’s a structured set of high-impact questions, organized by key analytical areas, to help guide your dashboard development:`

## Sales Performance Analysis

1. Who are the top-performing salespersons by revenue and by volume?

2. How have total sales evolved over time (weekly/monthly/quarterly)?

3. Which countries generate the highest sales revenue?

4. What is the average sale amount per transaction or per box?

5. Which salespeople consistently meet or exceed sales targets? (if targets are available)

## Product Performance

1. Which chocolate products have the highest and lowest sales volumes? 

Para saber o valor e a quantidade de caixa geral, por sabor: [Highest_lowest_sale_volume](../queries/highest_lowest_sale_volume.sql)

Para saber o valor e a quantidade minimas e máximas, por sabor: [Highest_lowest_sale_volume_2](../queries/highest_lowest_sale_volume_2.sql), considerando todos os países

para saber apenas a quantidade min e máxima total (independente do sabor), [min_max_caixas_vendidas](../queries/min_max_caixas_vendidas.sql)

2. What is the revenue breakdown by product category or product line?

Não tenho informações suficientes para calcular (precisaria de dados sobre os gastos também).

3. Are there any seasonal trends in the sale of specific products?

Para calcular isso eu preciso ter uma janela de tempo para entender o que é considerado comum, e o que é considerado diferente, e depois entender se essa diferença tem uma époda do ano em comum

4. Which product has the highest revenue per box?

Em [value_per_box](../queries/value_per_box.sql) da para ver o quanto custa a caixa de cada produto em relação à quantidade vendida

5. How does product preference vary by country or region?

É possível perceber que a maior parte dos países preferem diferentes chocolates.

## Customer and Geographic Insights

1. Which countries or regions are growing in sales over time?

2. Are there any underperforming regions or countries that require attention?

Usando a querie em [boxes_amount_per_country](../queries/boxes_amount_per_country.sql), podemos perceber que duas regiões perfomam muito parecido em numero de caixas (USA e New Zeland), porém NZ tem um valor arrecadado bem menor.


3. What are the top-selling products in each country?

[fav_choc_amount_per_country](../queries/fav_choc_amount_per_country.sql)

4. How does the average sale amount vary between countries?

## Time-based Analysis

1. Which months or quarters generate the highest chocolate sales?

2. Is there a trend or seasonality in box shipments?

3. What are the peak days of the week for chocolate sales?

4. Are there any unusual spikes or dips in sales that require explanation?

## Operational Efficiency

1. What is the average number of boxes shipped per sale?

2. How does shipment volume relate to total revenue?

3. Are some products generating less revenue despite high shipment volumes?

4. What is the average delivery size per salesperson/country?

## Forecasting & Strategy-Oriented

1. Based on past data, what are the projected sales for the next quarter?

2. Where should the company focus its marketing efforts to boost sales?

3. Which products or countries offer the greatest growth potential?
